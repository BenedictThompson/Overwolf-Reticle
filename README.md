Overwolf-Reticle
================

A reticle overlay for overwolf.

An online demo is available at: http://www.ubercpp.com/overlay/files


Features
========
Allows you to place a cross, outline-circle, circle/square, and an image in the
center of your screen with various customizations.


Future Plans
============



Remarks
=======
The code was written by myself, however the concept came from another overlay
with similar but different features called "Ultimate-Crosshair".  In fact, the
only reason I found out that "overwolf" even exists is because I found that
overlay.  I encourage competition, and only want you to choose my overlay if it
better meets your needs.
